# üèÖ Semifinalist: IDN IT Fest 2023
Scholarship Hunter made it to the semifinals of IDN Jonggol's IT Fest Web Development Competition but was discontinued due to the lack of time for development. This repository is made to revive this project, to develop it as a live site as it should have been. SCOHUNT's Concept was written by a small group of three; [Galatea](https://www.linkedin.com/in/galatea/), [Odit](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khadijahpassa/), and [myself](https://www.linkedin.com/in/syiffanoriza/). Together, we formed Sukatempe.

## üí° Background
SCOHUNT was born with the purpose and initiative to address inequality and problems in access to education in the form of scholarships. The platform is not just a search tool, but a mission to open doors of opportunity for every student, showing that they can have hope and pursue their dreams without any barriers. 

With this, SCOHUNT offers benefits that align with its purpose, namely: 
- SCOHUNT enables students from diverse backgrounds to discover and access scholarship opportunities that match their interests.
- SCOHUNT can serve as a bridge between interested individuals and scholarship providers.
- By presenting relevant and comprehensive scholarship information in one platform, SCOHUNT can help users save time.
